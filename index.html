            <h2>What is Calisthenics?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Calisthenics is a type of exercise that involves using a person's body-weight to carry out a variety of movements which involves very little or zero equipment. These exercises stimulate a variety of large muscle groups with movements such as jump squats, pull ups and push ups.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Why Calisthenics?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Calisthenics are affordable and convenient for all those involved. They can be done anywhere there is enough space to carry out the exercises. These exercises enable a high number of calories to be burnt as they require a lot of movement from multiple muscle groups at once. This in turn may help to build muscle, lose fat and gain strength.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Calisthenics can improve:</h2>
